        <p><em>Personal Quote: "I study Computer Science, therefore I am a Computer Scientist" </em>
            <br> I am a second year Student at UCT, majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.
            <br> Presently, I am busy with data structures and databases. 
            <br>Focusing on algorithm efficiency. If you are interesated in my projects, you can access them from my <a href="https://github.com/Waynium">git hub</a> repository.
            <br>However, I am currently busy with a web development course from Udemy.
            <hr size="3" noshade>
            <br>Apart from Computer Science, one the fields I am interested in is Design. I had some experience with it at school
            <br>where I did some design projects, including fashion design, product design, building prototypes. 
            <br>Doing design as a subject, encouraged me to be creative in an artistic sense. As I pursue mastering web development,
            <br>I will share my deesign projects and concepts I learned as a high school student, and what I think of them now.</p>

        <h3>Accomplished courses</h3>
        <p>I will list all the courses I have accomplished, and I will elaborate on the skills I have gained
        <br>from accomplishing each inividual course. Not all the coures are related to Computer Science, some 
        <br>are Mathematics based (like applied Mathematics and Physics). This is because I am also majoring
        <br>in Computer Engineering, which means I also did some electrical engineering courses and projects.
