# Personal-CV
I am going through a UDemy course on Web Development, and my first project was making a personal cv using html only
I have learned a lot, as a developer experienced in using other languages, (Python, Java, SQL), I undermined the importance 
of HTML. Building this personal CV site has made me realise that HTML is still important, (the elements have many useful attributes)
although CSS is the decorator, one can build an entire website from HTML alone.
